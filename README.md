# selenium_project

This is a Python Selenium WebDriver test to determine whether the actual heading of a Wikipedia page matches the expected result. (Hint: it doesn't pass)

It uses [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) to reproduce the environment in which it was built.

To run the test, clone the repo, switch into it, and run the following script:

`$ ./leapfrogscript.sh`
